SSMS 20.2 is the latest general availability (GA) version. If you are using a preview release of SSMS 20, it is advisable to uninstall it before installing SSMS 20.2. Note that installing SSMS 20.2 will not replace or update any prior versions, such as SSMS 19.x.

For feedback, suggestions, or issue reporting, you can reach the SSMS team through the SSMS Developer Community site.

SSMS 20.x will not overwrite SSMS 19.x or older versions; instead, both versions can be used simultaneously. If you have a previous preview version of SSMS 20, ensure it is uninstalled before installing the latest stable version. To check your version, open the **Help** > **About** section.
